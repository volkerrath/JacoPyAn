  abstract         = {Abstract Despite their apparent high dimensionality, spatially distributed hydraulic properties of geologic formations can often be compactly (sparsely) described in a properly designed basis. Hence, the estimation of high-dimensional subsurface flow properties from dynamic performance and monitoring data can be formulated and solved as a sparse reconstruction inverse problem. Recent advances in statistical signal processing, formalized under the compressed sensing paradigm, provide important guidelines on formulating and solving sparse inverse problems, primarily for linear models and using a deterministic framework. Given the uncertainty in describing subsurface physical properties, even after integration of the dynamic data, it is important to develop a practical sparse Bayesian inversion approach to enable uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we use sparse geologic dictionaries to compactly represent uncertain subsurface flow properties and develop a practical sparse Bayesian method for effective data integration and uncertainty quantification. The multi-Gaussian assumption that is widely used in classical probabilistic inverse theory is not appropriate for representing sparse prior models. Following the results presented by the compressed sensing paradigm, the Laplace (or double exponential) probability distribution is found to be more suitable for representing sparse parameters. However, combining Laplace priors with the frequently used Gaussian likelihood functions leads to neither a Laplace nor a Gaussian posterior distribution, which complicates the analytical characterization of the posterior. Here, we first express the form of the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate for Laplace priors and then use the Monte-Carlo-based Randomize Maximum Likelihood (RML) method to generate approximate samples from the posterior distribution. The proposed Sparse {RML} (SpRML) approximate sampling approach can be used to assess the uncertainty in the calibrated model with a relatively modest computational complexity. We demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the SpRML formulation using a series of numerical experiments of two-phase flow systems in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian property distributions in petroleum reservoirs and successfully apply the method to an adapted version of the PUNQ-S3 benchmark reservoir model.},

  abstract  = {Regularized inversion is the most commonly used interpretation method for magnetotellurics (MT) data. This leads to smooth models, which minimize the differences between the model response and the observed data. These models, however, do not represent the only possible solution. The inherent non-uniqueness of the problem and the errors in the data lead to the existence of equivalent models, that is, different models with very similar responses.Traditionally, equivalent models have been studied by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian matrix (also known as the sensitivity matrix). The sensitivity matrix relates small changes in the model parameters with the associated changes in the response. By adding a linear combination of singular vectors of the nullspace of the sensitivity matrix to a model vector (in the parameter space), the resulting model has the same fit to the data as the original model. This approach has been used successfully to construct equivalent models in 1-D cases, represented by a small number of parameters. The application of this technique to 2-D or 3-D cases, however, is unpractical because of the large number of parameters involved. This makes the intuitive interpretation of the singular vectors in physical and geological terms impossible.In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm, which seeks to unite the desirable features of the probabilistic and deterministic approaches to model appraisal; it generates a collection of models by a random modification of the segmented geoelectrical image's geometry. This represents a limited exploration of a subset of the parameter space characterized by similar geometry. We can then efficiently construct conservative models by projecting the changes introduced by the modification algorithm onto the nullspace of the original problem, thus maintaining the obtained fit to the data (in the linear approximation). In this way it is possible to test the structures obtained in 2-D MT inversions with respect to their resolution and inherent equivalencies. To illustrate the method, several numerical experiments with different structures and conditions are presented. In addition to these synthetic examples, a case study from SW Iberia is also shown.},

The routines can also calculate orthonormal bases for numer- ical null spaces, approximate pseudoinverse solutions to least squares problems involving rank- deficient matrices, and basic solutions to these problems. The algorithms are based on SPQR from SuiteSparseQR (ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 38, Article 8, 2011). SPQR is a high-performance routine for forming QR factorizations of large, sparse matrices. It returns an estimate for the numerical rank that is usually, but not always, correct. The new routines improve the accuracy of the numerical rank calculated by SPQR and reliably determine the numerical rank in the sense that, based on extensive testing with matrices from applications, the numerical rank is almost always accurately determined when our methods report that the numerical rank should be correct. Reliable determination of numerical rank is critical to the other calculations in the package. The routines work well for matrices with either small or large null space dimensions.},

In this paper we investigate the consequences of ill-posed problems, and show that correct reconstruction is generally not possible using conventional linear inversion techniques because latter methods disregard contributions of the nullspace. We describe the rationale of a novel image reconstruction method that estimates the nullspace contribution using prior knowledge in a maximum-aposteriori- probability framework. We illustrate our concept by an example of optical tomographic reconstruction from simulated and experimental data.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm for solving the large-scale discrete ill-conditioned linear problems arising from the discretization of linear or nonlinear inverse problems. The algorithm combines some existing regularization techniques and regularization parameter choice rules with a randomized singular value decomposition (SVD), so that only much smaller scale systems are needed to solve, instead of the original large-scale regularized system. The algorithm can directly apply to some existing regularization methods, such as the Tikhonov and truncated SVD methods, with some popular regularization parameter choice rules such as the L-curve, GCV function, quasi-optimality and discrepancy principle. The error of the approximate regularized solution is analyzed and the efficiency of the method is well demonstrated by the numerical examples.},

  abstract         = {We propose methods to efficiently explore the generalized nullspace of (non-linear) inverse problems, defined as the set of plausible models that explain observations within some misfit tolerance. Owing to the random nature of observational errors, the generalized nullspace is an inherently probabilistic entity, described by a joint probability density of tolerance values and model parameters. Our exploration methods rest on the construction of artificial Hamiltonian systems, where models are treated as high-dimensional particles moving along a trajectory through model space. In the special case where the distribution of misfit tolerances is Gaussian, the methods are identical to standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, revealing that its apparently meaningless momentum variable plays the intuitive role of a directional tolerance. Its direction points from the current towards a new acceptable model, and its magnitude is the corresponding misfit increase. We address the fundamental problem of producing independent plausible models within a high-dimensional generalized nullspace by autotuning the mass matrix of the Hamiltonian system. The approach rests on a factorized and sequentially preconditioned version of the L-BFGS method, which produces local Hessian approximations for use as a near-optimal mass matrix. An adaptive time stepping algorithm for the numerical solution of Hamilton?s equations ensures both stability and reasonable acceptance rates of the generalized nullspace sampler. In addition to the basic method, we propose variations of it, where autotuning focuses either on the diagonal elements of the mass matrix or on the macroscopic (long-range) properties of the generalized nullspace distribution. We quantify the performance of our methods in a series of numerical experiments, involving analytical, high-dimensional, multimodal test functions. These are designed to mimic realistic inverse problems, where sensitivity to different model parameters varies widely, and where parameters tend to be correlated. The tests indicate that the effective sample size may increase by orders of magnitude when autotuning is used. Finally, we present a proof of principle of generalized nullspace exploration in viscoelastic full-waveform inversion. In this context, we demonstrate (1) the quantification of inter- and intraparameter trade-offs, (2) the flexibility to change model parametrization a posteriori, for instance, to adapt averaging length scales, (3) the ability to perform dehomogenization to retrieve plausible subwavelength models and (4) the extraction of a manageable number of alternative models, potentially located in distinct local minima of the misfit functional.},

  abstract         = {Abstract Non-linear inversion of controlled source electromagnetic data is non-unique. Inversion ambiguity and uncertainty grow with model complexity and limitations in sensitivity, for example when imaging deep targets. Uncertainties should be estimated. The best way to do that is by statistical inversion techniques. Because of the large number of parameters of 3D models, these methods are too costly for 3D applications. But neglecting or underestimating uncertainties often leads to erroneous interpretation and poor exploration decisions. The number of inversion parameters can be dramatically reduced while still being able to describe a complex 3D subsurface. To obtain that, I represent prior information by an input ensemble of geologically reasonable prior models. The model space is defined by the principal directions of this ensemble, where the inversion parameters are the coefficients of the different components. In this model space, inversion becomes much more efficient and can produce an updated ensemble of posterior models at the same computational cost as a controlled-source electromagnetic inversion project using conventional non-linear inversion techniques. I present examples where unique Gauss?Newton inversions lead to difficult interpretations and poor conclusions about hydrocarbon presence and saturation. The new approach provides a quantitative estimation of resistivity ambiguities and uncertainties leading to better interpretation and safer decisions. The examples use 2D synthetic controlled-source electromagnetic data and 3D controlled-source electromagnetic field data.},

We adopt a Bayesian approach to the problem and work in a setting where the prior measure is specified as a Gaussian random field ?0. We work under a natural set of conditions on the likelihood which implies the existence of a well-posed posterior measure, ?y. Under these conditions, we show that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is well defined as the minimizer of an Onsager?Machlup functional defined on the Cameron?Martin space of the prior; thus, we link a problem in probability with a problem in the calculus of variations. We then consider the case where the observational noise vanishes and establish a form of Bayesian posterior consistency for the MAP estimator. We also prove a similar result for the case where the observation of  can be repeated as many times as desired with independent identically distributed noise. The theory is illustrated with examples from an inverse problem for the Navier?Stokes equation, motivated by problems arising in weather forecasting, and from the theory of conditioned diffusions, motivated by problems arising in molecular dynamics.},

Key properties of our methods are (i) low algorithmic complexity and easy implementation, (ii) applicability to any tomographic technique, including full-waveform inversion and linearized ray tomography, (iii) applicability in any spatial dimension and to inversions with a large number of model parameters, (iv) low computational costs that are mostly a fraction of those required for synthetic recovery tests, and (v) the ability to quantify both spatial resolution and interparameter trade-offs. Using synthetic full-waveform inversions as benchmarks, we demonstrate that autocorrelations of random-model applications to the Hessian yield various resolution measures, including direction- and position-dependent resolution lengths and the strength of interparameter mappings. We observe that the required number of random test models is around five in one, two, and three dimensions. This means that the proposed resolution analyses are not only more meaningful than recovery tests but also computationally less expensive. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in a 3-D real-data full-waveform inversion for the western Mediterranean. In addition to tomographic problems, resolution analysis by random probing may be used in other inverse methods that constrain continuously distributed properties, including electromagnetic and potential-field inversions, as well as recently emerging geodynamic data assimilation.},

  abstract         = {This paper explores the applicability of Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) with level-set parameterization for solving geophysical inverse problems. In particular, we focus on its extension to induced polarization (IP) data with uncertainty quantification. IP data may provide rich information on characteristics of geological materials due to its sensitivity to characteristics of the pore-grain interface. In many IP studies, different geological units are juxtaposed and the goal is to delineate these units and obtain estimates of unit properties with uncertainty bounds. Conventional inversion of IP data does not resolve well sharp interfaces and tends to reduce and smooth resistivity variations, while not readily providing uncertainty estimates. Recently, it has been shown for DC resistivity that EKI is an efficient solver for inverse problems which provides uncertainty quantification, and its combination with level set parameterization can delineate arbitrary interfaces well. In this contribution, we demonstrate the extension of EKI to IP data using a sequential approach, where the mean field obtained from DC resistivity inversion is used as input for a separate phase angle inversion. We illustrate our workflow using a series of synthetic and field examples. Variations with uncertainty bounds in both DC resistivity and phase angles are recovered by EKI, which provides useful information for hydrogeological site characterization. While phase angles are less well-resolved than DC resistivity, partly due to their smaller range and higher percentage data errors, it complements DC resistivity for site characterization. Overall, EKI with level set parameterization provides a practical approach forward for efficient hydrogeophysical imaging under uncertainty.},
